AI-Powered Mentoring System - Implemented Code Snapshot

Included files in this package:
- app.py : Flask backend implementing CSV upload, validation, stats, and mark updates.
- requirements.txt : Python dependencies found in the uploaded package.
- dataa.csv, students_marks.csv : Sample mark datasets used by the app.
- data/*.json and src/data/*.json : Sample JSON data for students, mentors, feedback, and approval queue.

Notes:
- This package reflects the code and data that were present in your uploaded v2.zip.
- The current backend is CSV-based (no database); there is no authentication, AI modules, or frontend included.
- For next steps, I can add JWT auth, role-based access, AI mentor-matching, and a React + Tailwind frontend.
